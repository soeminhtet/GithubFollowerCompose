# GithubFollowerCompose
This project is clone from Sean Allen's Take home project. I used clean architecture, android jetpack compose, kotlin coroutine and other modern liberaries to build this project and include unit test and ui test(compose ui test has so many bugs this time, I'll fix it when stable).
